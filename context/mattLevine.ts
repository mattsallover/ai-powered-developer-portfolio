Section: Entrepreneurial_Projects
Project: PostShowProfit
PostShowProfit is Matt Levine's ambitious media-technology venture centered on transforming live concert experiences into monetizable digital assets. The concept bridges live entertainment and AI, enabling fans to upload their personal concert footage through QR codes distributed at venues. The backend AI pipeline automatically synchronizes multiple crowd-shot videos with professionally captured board audio, generating a cinematic short-form highlight film within 48 hours.

Matt's vision for PostShowProfit stems from recognizing how fan-generated content can become a data-rich asset for artists, managers, and venues. His zero-risk 50/50 partnership model allows artists to share profits without upfront costs, while fans receive a premium memento of the experience. Matt designed the operational blueprint, from crew hiring to automated outreach systems that use n8n and Google Sheets to build and contact leads weekly. His goal is to scale the process through automation—scraping concert calendars, contacting artist management, and running follow-up email campaigns.

The broader strategy extends beyond production into fan engagement analytics, turning moments of shared experience into measurable value. The company's long-term vision is to become a hub for post-event storytelling, where AI enhances emotional connection rather than replacing it.

Project: Levine Toneworks
Levine Toneworks represents Matt's hands-on craftsmanship and technical artistry in guitar electronics. The brand focuses on analog devices that preserve the authenticity of live tone while introducing control and innovation. His flagship product, the "Levine Load Mini," is a reactive speaker attenuator built for real feel and real tone at manageable volume levels. The tagline—"Real feel. Real tone. Real quiet."—captures his philosophy of balancing power and subtlety.

Matt hand-builds and tests every circuit, sourcing high-quality components and designing enclosures that combine industrial durability with visual elegance. Each project integrates careful wiring, impedance tuning, and airflow design for heat management. He uses branding, decals, and layout design to give each unit a signature aesthetic that reflects both vintage and modern sensibilities. Levine Toneworks is both a brand and a workshop of continuous experimentation, where Matt merges engineering, design, and sonic exploration.

Project: Guitar Practice Journal
The Guitar Practice Journal is a web platform Matt built to help guitarists structure their musical growth through AI and data. Developed using React, Supabase, and OpenAI's GPT APIs, the application enables users to log practice sessions, track metrics, and receive AI-generated insights about progress. Each practice module—like CAGED visualization or fretboard fluency—has a scoring algorithm that quantifies improvement and suggests next steps.

Matt treats the Guitar Practice Journal as both a technical lab and a personal experiment. He continuously refines Supabase edge functions, vector embeddings for personalized recommendations, and metronome logic modules for real-time feedback. His long-term vision is to integrate AI coaches that adapt to user behavior, providing encouragement, critique, and custom exercises in natural language. The platform fuses his two lifelong passions: self-improvement through music and optimization through data.

Section: Technical_Competencies_and_Case_Applications
Matt Levine operates at the intersection of process optimization, AI implementation, and product design. His technical stack spans automation tools, backend development, and AI orchestration.

Automation and AI Tools:
- n8n for workflow automation, multi-agent orchestration, and API integration.
- ActivePieces and Zapier for no-code prototyping.
- LM Studio and Ollama for local model inference and offline AI use.
- Supabase for backend database, authentication, and storage services.
- Pinecone for vector embeddings and semantic retrieval.

Case Example: AI-Powered Concert Outreach
Matt built an automated pipeline that uses Serper.dev to extract upcoming concerts from regional calendars, structures them into JSON in n8n, and cross-references them against artist management databases. The system then uses Gmail API to send customized partnership emails, tracks responses, and appends results to Google Sheets. Each iteration of the workflow refines targeting, content tone, and follow-up logic—demonstrating his iterative, data-informed development style.

Case Example: Reactive Attenuator Engineering
In developing the Levine Load Mini, Matt designed a circuit network using an air-core inductor, L-pad resistive load, and a reactive speaker motor assembly. He optimized the system's impedance curve to simulate real speaker dynamics even under attenuation. He applies Ohm's law, resonance modeling, and empirical testing to fine-tune tonal characteristics. This balance of theory and craftsmanship defines his engineering mindset.

Case Example: Supabase + React Development
Matt uses Supabase to host full-stack apps. In his Guitar Practice Journal, he architected relational tables for users, practice logs, and module scores. React components interact with Supabase via secure REST endpoints, enabling real-time updates. Tailwind CSS provides a clean UI, while OpenAI API calls personalize the experience. The architecture demonstrates modular thinking and scalable design principles suitable for future commercial SaaS development.

Section: AI_and_Automation_Philosophy
Matt's philosophy on AI is rooted in augmentation, not replacement. He sees AI as a force multiplier that expands human creativity, reduces repetition, and democratizes access to sophisticated workflows. He believes that automation should serve clarity—freeing people to focus on insight, not input.

He builds systems that mirror human thinking: gather data, reason, act, and learn. His designs emphasize transparency, auditability, and graceful failure handling. He resists black-box automation and prefers systems where users can see logic flow and outcomes. His approach is shaped by Lean principles—visualize work, reduce waste, and create continuous feedback loops. The goal is not simply speed, but improvement through learning cycles.

Matt envisions a future where individuals use AI agents as personal process partners. His n8n projects are prototypes for this vision: distributed cognition, orchestrated through accessible automation. He believes the combination of open-source tools and local LLMs will empower individuals to build private, high-performance systems without dependence on centralized providers.
